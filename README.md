# KSU_CS4632_SUMOproject

A basic 4-way interesection implemented using SUMO. This is just a preliminary model that I made to get a feel for the program and more will be added to it. Currently, there are a few demand flows set on some of the avaliable routes that are set with some different arbitrary traffic rates. The .netecfg file contains the primary network info (reads from the .net and .rou .xml files). This can be imported into netedit to view the details of the network. The .sumoconfg contains the actual simulation data and can be run in the SUMO GUI. The delay can be adjusted in order to view the simulation at different speeds.
